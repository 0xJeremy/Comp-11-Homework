1. 	chmod a-rw awesome.cpp
	chmod u+rw awesome.cpp

2.	A - void foo(int &, int);
		B - string bar();
		C - int x = 5;
			int y = 10;
			foo(x, y);
		D - string x = bar();

3. 	A - 5 6
        6 6
        6 7
    B - 5 6
        8 5
        7 10

4. 	void user_turn(int &num_vampires, int &num_stakes, bool &buffy_dead)
	void stake_attack(int &num_vampires, int &num_stakes, bool &buffy_dead)
	bool stake_check(int num_stakes, int stakes_needed)
	void spell_attack(int &num_vampires, int &num_stakes, bool &buffy_dead)
	void run_away(int &num_stakes, bool &buffy_dead)
	void buffy_died(bool &buffy_dead)
	void status_print(int num_vampires, int num_stakes, bool buffy_dead)

	user_turn will be called multiple times and each time 
		will allow the user to make a move.
	stake_attack will be called from user_turn and will be
		for when the user decides to use a stake to attack the vampires.
	spell_attack will be called from user_turn and will be
		for when the user decides to use a spell to attack the vampires.
	run_away will be called from user_turn and will cause 
		the user to run away from the attack.
	buffy_died will modify the boolean value of if Buffy is
		alive or dead.
	status_print will be called after user_turn from the main
		 function and will print out the number of vampires, the
		 number of stakes left, and if buffy is alive of dead.
