4. Use the variables choice_one, choice_two, etc. Have the user input these as strings or ints (depending on extra credit), and then confirm inputs are correct.
   Have a variable "points" be an integer keeping the players score.
   - cout "greeting"
   - cout "enter name"
   - cin "name"
   - cout "offer choices Yes/No"
   - cin choice_one
   - if(yes)
	- cout offer new choices, use player name
	- cin choice_two
	- add points from previous answer
	- if(yes)
		- cout "[player name] wins!"
		- add points to previous value
	- if(no)
		- cout "[player name] loses"
   - if(no)
	- cout "[player name] loses"

5. In my labyrinth code I accidently included semicolins after the #include statements.
   These did not throw an error, just a warning, and so I was able to easily correct
   my code. I got errors when I forgot '<<' between a text statement and a variable
   when using cout. These were also easily corrected before the code ran. Other
   than these there were no seriously warnings or errors.
