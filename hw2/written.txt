6. - Set the four master pegs to be constant chars (const char MASTER_PEG_0, MASTER_PEG_1, etc)
   - Welcome the user
   - Tell the user which pegs colors they can enter
   - Prompt the user to enter four pegs
   - Use a while loop to repeat the following:
	   - Store user peg colors as chars (peg0, peg1, etc)
	   - Using while loops, identify if any of the pegs are not the correct colors
	   - List white pegs and black pegs using if statements to determine user input
		- Use conditionals to test peg entries to master key for black pegs
		- Use conditions with or statements to other master key for white pegs
		- For white pegs: also test against other peg entries to avoid double counting
	   - Print out white and black pegs
	   - Ask if the user wishes to continue
	   - Repeat loop if(yes)
	   - Break loop if(no)
   - Congratulate user when they get the correct colors
